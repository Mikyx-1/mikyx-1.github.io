I am an AI engineer specialising in **Computer Vision**, **Efficient Computing**, and **Reinforcement Learning**. My work sits at the intersection of machine learning algorithms and high-performance systems, where I focus on building models that are not only intelligent, but also computationally efficient and production-ready.


Currently, I am working as an AI Engineer at a Japanese start-up [MonoRevo Inc.] I got my Bachelor's degree from Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh.


I’m always open to collaborations, discussions, and new opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in my research or would like to discuss potential projects.


**Research interests:** 

**1. Computer Vision:**  I primarily focus on Vision–Language Models (VLMs) and advanced vision architectures, aiming to build both state-of-the-art models and compact, efficient models for low-resource environments, maintaining strong performance while reducing computational cost.

**2. Efficient Computing:**  I also work on analysing computational bottlenecks in deep learning systems and improving efficiency through algorithmic redesign (fusion, sampling, quantisation), heterogeneous computing strategies.


**3. Reinforcement Learning:**  With a background in Automation and Control Engineering, I am particularly interested in improving training efficiency and convergence in complex environments. I design methods and systems that enable reinforcement learning models to learn faster, generalise better, and require less interaction data.
